This repository demonstrates a common but often difficult-to-debug error in VBScript: an array index out of bounds error that results in silent script termination. The `bug.vbs` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` shows how to improve error handling to make debugging easier.  VBScript's limited error reporting makes this type of bug particularly insidious.  Proper error handling is crucial for robust VBScript applications.
